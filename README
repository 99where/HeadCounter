= Head Counter =

The aim of this software is to be able to count the number of people present in a crowd, especially in protests, and provide an estimate as accurate as possible. This software is currently at a very early stage.

This project used to be on bitbucket when I was using mainly mercurial, before discovering git. I imported it without the history. As I was the sole contributor to this project, this is not a huge loss. I put it here in the hope I will be able to improve it a bit. I have not used it for 2 years and apaprently it doesn't work anymore with the most recent versions of openCV.

Be warned that it probably does not work out of the box right now.

= Compilation = 

You need OpenCV to compile this software. It should work well with the latest opencv from debian and ubuntu as well. It uses CMake to build. The process is as follow :

cd HeadCounter
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

this should compile both cvplayer and headcounter.

cvplayer is a simple test utility to check that your opencv configuration manage to read a specific file

headcounter is the main program. headcounter -h gives you instruction on how to use it.
